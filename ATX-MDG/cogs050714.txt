<Name> Acetaminophen (APAP) (Tylenol) 
<Class>    Analgesic, Antipyretic. 
<Action>    Equivalent to aspirin in both analgesic and antipyretic effects.  Unlike 
aspirin, acetaminophen has little effect on platelet function, no effect 
on homeostasis, and is not known to produce gastric bleeding.  
Acetaminophen is not an NSAID, as it has no anti-inflammatory 
properties. Its function was largely a mystery until the early 1990’s 
when it was found that it acted on a variant of cyclooxygenase called 
COX3 that is only expressed in the central nervous system. Because 
it does not work on COX1 and COX2 (like ASA) it does not cause the 
downstream effects on platelets or the immune system.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Absorption is rapid, peak 1-2h, duration 3-4h, ½life 1-3h. APAP is 
processed in the Liver. 
<Contraindications>    Use in caution with children afflicted with arthritic or rheumatoid 
conditions.  Use in caution with known thrombocytopenia and/or Liver 
Disease  
<Adverse Effects>    N/V, abdominal pain,  
<Indications>    Fever with or without seizures or Pain. 
<Dosing>    Per Protocols: M-09, M-16, PM-03, PM-06, PM-07  
Clinical Reference: CR - 27 

<Name> Adenosine 
<Class>    Antidysrhythmic 
<Action>    Slows AV node conduction, interrupts reentry pathways. Adenosine 
works in a variety of receptors grouped into a group called P1 
receptors. The true mechanism is somewhat unclear. Adenosine 
works through the activation of cAMP and coupled G-proteins to 
cause its cardiac effects.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Immediate onset and peak, half-life 10s. 
<Contraindications>    Known hypersensitivity.  Sick Sinus Syndrome. Second or third 
degree AV block. Use with caution in patients with severe asthma. 
<Adverse Effects>    Flushing, CP, HA, N/V, hypotension 
<Indications>    Symptomatic (poor perfusion) narrow complex tachycardia w/ pulse 
<Dosing>    Per Protocols: C-04, PC-02

<Name> Amiodarone 
<Class>    Antidysrhythmic 
<Action>    Prolongs the duration of the action potential and refractory period of 
all Cardiac fibers. Depresses the Phase 0 slope by causing a sodium 
blockade. Causes a Beta block as well as a weak calcium channel 
blockade. Therefore it decreases the SA nodes rate of firing, 
suppresses automaticity, interrupts reentrant pathways and prolongs 
PR, QRS and QT intervals. Relaxes vascular smooth muscle, 
decreases peripheral vascular resistance, and increases coronary 
contractility. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Rapid onset, serum concentrations drop to 10% w/in 30-45 minutes. 
<Contraindications>    Cardiogenic shock, bradycardia, second/third degree block 
<Adverse Effects>    Vasodilation (usually not associated with decreased cardiac output 
secondary to the negative inotropic effects), hypotension, bradycardia, 
AV block, increased QT interval, V-Tach 
<Indications>    Ventricular Arrhythmias or W ide Complex Tachycardia with or without 
a pulse

<Name> Aspirin 
<Class>    Analgesic, Antipyretic, NSAID, platelet inhibitor 
<Action>    Inhibits the formation of prostaglandins associated with pain, fever, 
and inflammation.  Inhibits platelet aggregation by acetylating 
cyclooxygenase permanently disabling it so that it cannot synthesize 
prostaglandins and Thromboxanes. Since Thromboxane A2 is 
important in clotting its absence does not allow blood to clot 
effectively. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset 5-30m, peak in 15m-2h, duration is 1-4h. 
<Contraindications>    Allergy, ulcer, GI bleeding 
Precaution    Patients with known ASA or NSAIDs sensitive Asthma (defer to

<Name> Atropine Sulfate 
<Class>    Parasympatholytic 
<Action>    Competitive antagonist that selectively blocks all muscarinic 
responses to acetylcholine.  Blocks vagal impulses, thereby 
increasing SA node discharge, thereby enhancing AV conduction and 
cardiac output.  Potent anti-secretory effects caused by the blocking 
of acetylcholine at the muscarinic site. Atropine is also useful in the 
treatment of the symptoms associated with nerve agent poisoning. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Rapid onset, peak in 2-4m IV, half-life 2-3h.

<Name> Calcium Chloride 
<Class>    Inotropic Agent (electrolyte) 
<Action>    Replaces elemental calcium, which is essential for regulating 
excitation threshold of nerves and muscles. Calcium is also essential 
for blood clotting mechanisms, maintenance of renal function, and 
bone tissues. Calcium increases myocardial contractile force and 
ventricular automaticity. 
Additionally serves as an antidote for magnesium sulfate and calcium 
channel blocker toxicity. Calcium chloride has three times as much 
elemental calcium than calcium gluconate.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset and peak are immediate 
<Contraindications>    V-Fib, renal/cardiac insufficiency, patients taking digitalis, 
hypercalcemia 
<Adverse Effects>    Arrhythmias including bradycardia or cardiac arrest, Syncope, N/V, 
Hypotension, Necrosis with extravasation. Calcium chloride will 
precipitate when used in conjunction with sodium bicarbonate, 
Toxicity with digitalis, and may antagonize the effects of calcium 
channel blockers. 
<Indications>    Calcium channel blocker toxicity/overdose, Acute hyperkalemia, Acute 
hypocalcemia, Acute hypermagnesemia 
<Dosing>    Per Protocols: C-02, CA-02, CA-03, CA-06, M-15

<Name> Chlorohexadine Gluconate 
<Class>    skin antiseptic 
<Action>    Disinfect/clean skin with an antiseptic that contains a minimum of a 
2% chlorhexidine-based preparation before sharp appliance insertion. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Found to possess a high level of antibacterial activity, low mammalian 
toxicity and a strong affinity for binding to the skin. The antimicrobial 
action of CHG is attributed to the disruption of the microbial cell 
membrane and precipitation of cell contents. Provides residual effect 
up to 2 days 
<Contraindications>    None for System use. 
Precaution    Allow the antiseptic to remain on the site and to air dry before catheter 
insertion, approximately 30 seconds. Chlorohexidine is a skin 
antiseptic and is not approved for use on environmental surfaces.  
<Adverse Effects>    Handle with care. In case of eye contact, immediately flush eye with 
plenty of water, if irritation persists, seek medical attention. 
<Indications>    Necessary skin preparation prior to the application of a sharp 
appliance including, but not limited to venous catheters, intraosseous 
infusion needles, lancets, and the delivery of medications or 
immunizations through syringes either intramuscular, dermal, or 
subcutaneous.

<Name> Dextrose (D10W) 
<Class>    Carbohydrate. Dextrose (aka. glucose) is one of the basic building 
blocks of all sugars. Glucose is a monomer and is therefore readily 
processed in the blood. Through glycolysis glucose is turned into 
pyruvate giving off a small amount of chemical energy (ATP). 
Pyruvate is further processed through the Citric Acid Cycle (Kreb’s 
Cycle) yielding even more energy (GTP, FADH2 and NADH) and 
CO2. The GTP, FADH2 and NADH are then converted into a large 
amount of ATP through the use of a specialized cell membrane and 
the ability of Oxygen to receive extra protons and carbon to form 
water and CO2.  Insulin turns excess glucose into glycogen when 
blood sugars are high. Glucose is a large molecule that forms a ring, 
this structure is incapable of being absorbed into a cell without a 
mediator (insulin) and therefore increases damage to epithelium as it 
floats through the blood stream. It also causes an osmotic pressure as 
concentrations vary across membranes. The pressure is less with D5 
and D10 therefore they are used in pediatrics. 
<Action>    Principal form of glucose used by the body 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Rapid absorption in bloodstream 
<Contraindications>    Use with caution in patients with suspected increased ICP. 
<Adverse Effects>    Patients may complain of warmth, pain, or burning at the injection site.  
Extravasation causes necrosis. 
<Indications>    Cardiac Arrest or altered mentation with Glucose level < 50 or Newly 
Born with heart rate < 60

<Name> Diltiazem 
<Class>    Diltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium ion cellular influx inhibitor (slow channel 
blocker or calcium antagonist). 
<Action>    Calcium channel blockers are drugs that block the entry of calcium 
into the muscle cells of the heart and arteries. The entry of calcium is 
critical for the conduction of the electrical signal that passes from 
muscle cell to muscle cell of the heart, and signals the cells to 
contract. It also is necessary in order for the muscle cells to contract 
and thereby pump blood. In the arteries, the entry of calcium into 
muscle cells causes contraction of the cells and thereby dilates 
(widens) the arteries. Thus, by blocking the entry of calcium, calcium 
channel blockers reduce electrical conduction within the heart, 
decrease the force of contraction (work) of the muscle cells, and dilate 
arteries. Dilation of the arteries reduces blood pressure and thereby 
the effort the heart must exert to pump blood. Combined with 
decreases in the force of contraction, this leads to a reduced 
requirement for oxygen by the heart. Dilation of the arteries provides 
more oxygen-carrying blood to the heart. The combination of reduced 
demand for oxygen and increased delivery of oxygen prevents angina 
or heart pain. (Angina occurs when the heart is not getting enough 
oxygen relative to the amount of work it is doing.) In addition, calcium 
channel blockers slow electrical conduction through the heart and 
thereby correct abnormal rapid heartbeats. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver and 
excreted by the kidneys and in bile. 
<Contraindications>    Diltiazem is contraindicated in (1) patients with sick sinus syndrome 
except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker, (2) 
patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence 
of a functioning ventricular pacemaker, (3) patients with hypotension 
(less than 90 mm Hg systolic), (4) patients who have demonstrated 
hypersensitivity to the drug, and (5) patients with acute myocardial 
infarction and pulmonary congestion. 
Precaution    Cardiac Conduction: Diltiazem prolongs AV node refractory periods 
without significantly prolonging sinus node recovery time, except in 
patients with sick sinus syndrome. Concomitant use of diltiazem with 
beta-blockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac 
conduction 
<Adverse Effects>    Headache, constipation, rash, nausea, flushing, edema, drowsiness, 
low blood pressure, and dizziness. 
<Indications>    Atrial Fibrillation with RVR, Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia 
<Dosing>    Per Protocol C-03, C-04 

<Name> Diphenhydramine 
<Class>    Antihistamine, Ethanolamine, Anticholinergic 
<Action>    Diphenhydramine blocks the effects of Histamine (H1 histamine) on 
the H1 receptor site through a competitive competition for the 
peripheral H1 site. When diphenhydramine is bound the H1 site 
cannot be stimulated preventing the effects of histamines (swelling, 
etc…). As an H1 blocker diphenhydramine blocks the effects of H1 on 
its receptor in the cortex as well this causes a change in the cortex 
neural potassium channels causing neurons in the cortex to have a 
higher threshold to depolarize. This results in an increase in sedation 
as a result of the H1 block.  As an antihistamine, diphenhydramine 
one of the most effective antihistamines.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset of 15m IV, peak 1-4h, ½ life 2-10h. 
<Contraindications>    Known allergy. 
<Adverse Effects>    Potent anticholinergic agent. Mydriasis, Photophobia, ataxia, 
tachycardia 
<Indications>    Hives/Rash or Adult dystonic reaction 
<Dosing>    Per Protocols: M-02, M-05, PM-01, PM-09 
 
<Name> Dopamine 
<Class>    Sympathomimetic, Catecholamine 
<Action>    Naturally occurring hormone and preceptor to Norepinephrine.  This 
catecholamine has different effects at different doses due to the 
sensitivity of receptors at different sites being related to the 
concentration of dopamine present. At low doses (2-5 mcg/kg/min) 
Dopamine increases the perfusion of the mesenteric arteries and the 
kidneys. Low doses can be used to try and perfuse an ischemic bowel 
or a failing kidney. Has a direct action on alpha and beta-adrenergic 
receptors. As doses are increased (5-10 mcg/kg/min), beta receptors 
are stimulated increasing force of contraction as well as heart rate and 
conduction. As dopamine becomes more concentrated (10-20 
mcg/kg/min) the less sensitive peripheral alpha receptors become 
activated this causes a increase in vascular constriction  that 
increases as the drug becomes more concentrated until at 20 
mcg/kg/min the effects are mainly on the peripheral vasculature. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset <5m, duration <10m, ½ life 2m. 
<Contraindications>    Pheochromocytoma (adrenal tumors), tachydysrhythmias, HTN 
<Adverse Effects>    Tachydysryhthmias, VF, VT, AMI, N/V, HA.

<Name> Enalaprilat (Vasotec) 
<Class>    Enalaprilat (a.k.a. – Enalapril) injection is a sterile aqueous solution 
for intravenous administration. Enalaprilat is an angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. 
<Action>    Intravenous enalaprilat, or oral enalapril, after hydrolysis to 
enalaprilat, inhibits ACE in human subjects and animals. ACE is a 
peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to 
the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also 
stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of 
ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to 
decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone 
secretion. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    A clinical response is usually seen within 15 minutes. Peak effects 
after the first dose may not occur for up to four hours after dosing, 
although most of the effect is usually apparent within the first hour. 
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. 
<Contraindications>    Enalaprilat injection is contraindicated in patients who are 
hypersensitive to any component of this product and in patients with a 
history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and in patients with 
hereditary, idiopathic angioedema, known pregnancy or Hypotension. 
Precaution    The risk of toxic reactions of this drug may be greater in patients with 
impaired renal function.  
<Adverse Effects>    Hypertensive patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those 
with the following concurrent conditions or characteristics: heart 
failure, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive 
diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume 
and/or salt depletion of any etiology. 
<Indications>    Enalaprilat injection is indicated for the treatment of Hypertension in

potent alpha agonist.  Beta1: Strengthens myocardial contraction, 
increase sys BP (may decrease dia BP), increases HR and cardiac 
output.  Beta2: Dilates bronchial smooth muscle and inhibits mucous 
secretion.  Alpha: Constricts bronchiole arterioles, inhibits histamine 
release, constricts arterioles in the skin, mucous membranes, and 
kidneys but dilates those in the skeletal muscle. Action is through a 
natural hormonal mechanism.

<Name> Fentanyl Citrate 
<Class>    Narcotic analgesic 
<Action>    The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Opioid (narcotic, CNS-acting) analgesics are derivatives of opium. 
These drugs modify the perception of pain and provide a sense of 
euphoria by binding to specific opiate receptors throughout the central 
nervous system. Many of the characteristics of particular opioids 
relate to the receptor to which they bind. Fentanyl is classified as a full 
agonists and binds to mu receptor sites, blocks pain impulses, and 
produces maximum pain control. Onset immediate, peak 3-5m, 
duration 30-60m. 
<Contraindications>    Fentanyl is not indicated for MAOI use, asthma, myasthenia gravis, 
evidence of hypoperfusion. 
<Adverse Effects>    Fentanyl may cause muscle rigidity, particularly involving the muscles 
of respiration. In addition, skeletal muscle movements of various 
groups in the extremities, neck and external eye have been reported 
during induction of anesthesia with fentanyl; these reported 
movements have, on rare occasions, been strong enough to pose 
patient management problems. This effect is related to the dose and 
speed of injection and its incidence can be reduced by slower 
administration and lower doses titrated to effect. As with other narcotic 
analgesics, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to 
occur with fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnea, rigidity, and 
bradycardia; if these remain untreated, respiratory arrest, circulatory 
depression or cardiac arrest could occur. Other adverse reactions that 
have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred 
vision, nausea, emesis, laryngospasm, and diaphoresis.

<Name> Hydroxocobalamin (Vitamin B12) 
<Class>    Vitamin 
<Action>    Hydroxocobalamin binds with Cyanide to form nontoxic 
cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted in the urine. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    The predominant mean half-life of free and total cobalamins-(III) was 
found to be approximately 26 to 31 hours at both the 5 g and 10 g 
dose level. The mean total amount of cobalamins-(III) excreted in 
urine during the collection period of 72 hours was about 60% of a 5 g 
dose and about 50% of a 10 g dose of hydroxocobalamin. Overall, the 
total urinary excretion was calculated to be at least 60 to 70% of the 
administered dose. The majority of the urinary excretion occurred 
during the first 24 hours, but red-colored urine was observed for up to 
35 days following the intravenous infusion. 
<Contraindications>    Known anaphylactic reactions to hydroxocobalamin or 
cyanocobalamin  
<Adverse Effects>    Anaphylaxis, chest tightness, edema, urticaria, pruritus, dyspnea, 
rash, and angioneurotic edema. Substantial increases in blood 
pressure may occur following CYANOKIT® therapy.

<Name> Glucagon 
<Class>    Hormone 
<Action>    Causes a breakdown of stored blood glycogen to glucose and inhibits 
glycogen synthesis. Glucagons acts by binding to glucagon receptor 
sites and stimulating a secondary messenger through the increase of 
adenylate cyclase. Beta stimulation causes an increase in the 
adenylate cyclase. Therefore glucagon has been known to have beta 
like effects just as Beta drugs such as Epinephrine are known to 
stimulate Glycogenolysis in the liver. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset 5-20m, peak 30m, duration 1-1.5h.  ½ life30m. 
<Contraindications>    Not efficacious in poorly nourished individuals as they have no 
glycogen stores.

<Name> Haloperidol 
<Class>    Antipsychotic 
<Action>    The precise mechanism of action has not been clearly established. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. 
<Contraindications>    Severe toxic central nervous system depression or comatose states 
from any cause and in individuals who are hypersensitive to this drug 
or have Parkinson's disease.  
Precaution    Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis. 
<Adverse Effects>    Tachycardia, hypotension, and hypertension have been reported. QT 
prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported, 
in addition to ECG pattern changes compatible with the polymorphous 
configuration of torsade de pointes, and may occur more frequently 
with high doses and in predisposed patients. Symptoms of dystonia, 
prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in 
susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic 
symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes 
progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty 
breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can 
occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater 
severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation 
antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in 
males and younger age groups. The risk of toxic reactions of this drug 
may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
<Indications>    Haloperidol is used to treat certain mental/mood disorders (e.g., 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders). It can also help prevent 
suicide in people who are likely to harm themselves. It also reduces 
aggression and the desire to hurt others. It can decrease negative 
thoughts and hallucinations. Haloperidol can also be used to treat 
uncontrolled movements and outbursts of words/sounds related to 
Tourettes disorder. Haloperidol is also used for severe behavior 
problems in hyperactive children when other treatments or 
medications have not worked. Haloperidol is a psychiatric medication 
(antipsychotic-type) that works by helping to restore the balance of 
certain natural substances in the brain (neurotransmitters). 
<Dosing>    Per Protocol: M-05 
 
<Name> Hurricaine/Cetacaine Spray 
<Class>    Topical anesthetic; Contains 14-20% Benzocaine 
<Action>    Blocks conduction of impulses at the sensory nerve endings. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Benzocaine is an ester, a compound made from the organic acid 
PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) and ethanol. 
Pain is caused by the stimulation of nerve endings. When the nerve 
endings are stimulated, sodium enters the nerve ending, which 
causes an electrical signal to build up in the nerve. Once the electrical 
signal becomes big enough, it is able to travel to the brain, which then 
interprets this as pain. 
Esters of PABA work as a chemical barrier, stopping the sodium from 
being able to enter the nerve ending. 
<Contraindications>    Known sensitivity to Benzocaine anesthetics. 
<Adverse Effects>    Benzocaine is a well-known cause of methemoglobinemia. Because it 
may be used in topical creams with a concentration as much as 20%, 
it is not difficult to administer a dose sufficient to cause this problem. 
<Indications>    To facilitate nasal intubation attempts in patients with a gag reflex. 
<Dosing>    Per Clinical Procedure: CP-44  

<Name> Ibuprofen 
<Class>    Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) 
<Action>    Ibuprofen possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode of 
action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but 
may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition, by blocking the 
enzyme in your body that makes prostaglandins. Decreasing 
prostaglandins helps to reduce pain, swelling, and fever.  
<Pharmacokinetics>    Ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed. Peak serum ibuprofen levels are 
generally attained one to two hours after administration. Ibuprofen is 
rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The excretion of 
ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. The serum 
half-life is 1.8 to 2.0 hours. 
<Contraindications>    In patients with known hypersensitivity and should not be given to 
patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type 
reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, 
anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such 
patients. Contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the 
setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 
Precaution    Pregnancy, aspirin-sensitive asthma, coagulation disorders or patients 
receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored. 
<Adverse Effects>    Heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, heart failure from body 
swelling (fluid retention), kidney problems including kidney failure, 
bleeding and ulcers in the stomach and intestine, low red blood cells 
(anemia), life-threatening skin reactions, life-threatening allergic 
reactions, liver problems including liver failure, asthma attacks in 
people who have asthma. 
<Indications>    Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which 
relieves pain and swelling (inflammation). It is used to treat 
headaches, muscle aches, backaches, dental pain, menstrual 
cramps, arthritis, or athletic injuries. This medication is also used to 
reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pains due to the common 
cold or flu.

in the His-purkinje system and by elevating the electrical stimulation 
threshold of ventricular contractions. This is accomplished by blocking 
the rapid influx of Na+ during the initial phase of depolarization. 
Typically shortens the action potential and the refractory period 
secondary to a blockade of sodium channels that usually (in 
procainamide’s blockade) continue to function normally through phase 
2 of the action potential. Lidocaine functions well in hyperkalemic and 
acidotic states therefore it works well on ischemic tissues.

<Name> Magnesium Sulfate 50% 
<Class>    Electrolyte 
<Action>    Molecularly Mg+ is very similar to Ca as it has the same electron 
valence. Because of this it chemically very similarly to Ca+ and in 
some reactions in the body. Ca+ is significantly larger than Mg+ 
therefore Mg+ does not adequately replace it in cases that are not 
purely chemical. Because of these qualities Mg+ can prevent Ca+ 
from binding to Troponin and prevent muscles from contracting as 
described in the action for “Calcium Gluconate”. Because of its 
extremely positive charge it also blocks neuromuscular transmission 
by changing the electric potentials threshold. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Onset immediate, duration 30m 
<Contraindications>    Renal disease, AV block, previous myocardial damage. 
<Adverse Effects>    Hypotension, asystole, cardiac arrest, respiratory/CNS depression, 
flushing, sweating. 
<Indications>    Obstetrical Emergencies/ Seizures (adult only), Reactive Airway 
Disease, Toxic Exposure (Hydrofluoric Acid), Pulseless Arrest, 
Tachycardia w/ pulse (adults only). 
<Dosing>    Per Protocols: C-05, CA-03, CA-06, OB-02, PR-03, PCA-03, PC-03,

When the Protocols call for an infusion over time: Place the M/S 
dose into a 50ml/NS and infuse over the time indicated per 
protocol.  

<Name> Terbutaline Sulfate 
<Class>    beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilator available as a sterile, 
nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution in vials, for subcutaneous 
administration. 
<Action>    Terbutaline is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. In vitro and in vivo 
pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that terbutaline exerts a 
preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors. While it is 
recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant 
receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a 
population of beta2-receptors in the human heart, existing in a 
concentration between 10% to 50%. The precise function of these 
receptors has not been established. Controlled clinical studies have 
shown that terbutaline relieves bronchospasm in acute and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease by significantly increasing pulmonary 
flow rates (e.g., an increase of 15% or more in FEV1). After 
subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg of terbutaline, a measurable 
change in expiratory flow rate usually occurs within 5 minutes, and a 
clinically significant increase in FEV1 occurs within 15 minutes. The 
maximum effect usually occurs within 30 to 60 minutes, and clinically 
significant bronchodilator activity may continue for 1.5 to 4 hours. The 
duration of clinically significant improvement is comparable to that 
observed with equimilligram doses of epinephrine. 
<Pharmacokinetics> N/A
<Contraindications>    Terbutaline sulfate injection is contraindicated in patients known to be 
hypersensitive to sympathomimetic amines or any component of this 
drug product. 
Precaution    Terbutaline, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with 
caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic 
heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with 
hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are 
unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines or who have 
convulsive disorders. 
<Adverse Effects>    Significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been 
seen and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any 
beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.Immediate hypersensitivity reactions 
and exacerbations of bronchospasm have been reported after 
terbutaline administration. 
<Indications>    Respiratory distress in patients > 36 Kg during remote rescue events 
with significant extraction time and transport delay  
<Dosing>    Per Protocol: SO-01 
 
<Name> Vecuronium Bromide 
<Class>    Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker 
<Action>    The relaxation of skeletal muscles which facilitates endotracheal 
intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
<Pharmacokinetics>    Binds to receptors and prevents acetylcholine (Ach) from stimulating 
receptors. It competes with Ach for nicotinic receptor binding sites. 
The blockade is competitive, hence muscle paralysis occurs 
gradually. 
<Contraindications>    None 
<Adverse Effects>    Prolonged paralysis 
<Indications>    To facilitate invasive cooling procedure. 
<Dosing>    Per Protocol: CA-04 

<Name> Xylocaine Gel 
<Class>    anesthetic 
<Action>    stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for 
the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby, effecting local anesthetic 
action. Local anesthetics of the amide type are thought to act within the 
sodium channels of the nerve membrane.  
 <Pharmacokinetics> ........ After application local anesthesia is achieved within 5 minutes. 
Duration of anesthesia is approximately 20 - 30 minutes.  
<Contraindications>    Lidocaine HCl is contraindicated in patients with a known history of 
hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type. 
<Adverse Effects> N/A
<Indications>    Nasal preparation prior to Nasal Tracheal Intubation attempt
